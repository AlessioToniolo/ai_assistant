Based on the relevant context provided, there are a few options for moving components from a conveyor belt:

1. Pick and place robot arm - A robotic arm equipped with grippers or suction cups can be programmed to pick up components from specific locations on the conveyor belt and place them at an assembly station or the next stage of the manufacturing process. This is an automated solution well-suited for repetitive, precise component handling.

2. Mobile robot - An autonomous mobile robot (AMR) can be used to transport totes or trays of components that it picks up from the end of the conveyor belt. The mobile robot can then navigate the factory floor to deliver the components to various workstations or the next assembly area as needed. This allows flexible material transport within the facility.

3. Human workers - For delicate, complex, or highly variable components, human workers can be stationed to manually remove components from the conveyor belt and transfer them to the next process step. Ergonomic workstations can be set up alongside the conveyor.

4. Conveyor transfer - Components can also be automatically transferred from one conveyor to another that is perpendicular or at an angle via guides, rails, pushers or other mechanisms. This allows routing parts without manual intervention.

The best option depends on the specific components, required speed, factory layout, automation level, and budget. Often a combination of methods is utilized in manufacturing environments to optimize material flow from conveyor belts.
